# sudoku-graphs
Graph structures based on sudoku's concepts.

## TODO List

* ~~Check graph search algorithm results (for N=3 |graphs set| = 93 or |graphs set| = 208) compared with older versions (PRIORITY)~~.
* ~~Code memory reallocation for solutions vector (SudokuSet)~~.
* ~~Change the arguments to pass by reference when necessary (optimization in runtime)~~.
* ~~Implement graph search algorithm~~.
* ~~Add in GraphSet labels vector to remove valueOfCell function~~.
* ~~Implement sub-algo for binary sequences generation~~.
* ~~Add code for graphical plots of graphs using GraphViz lib (Python script)~~.
* ~~Add in GraphSet struct k_bits vector to optimize algorithm~~.
* Code hashCode func to check isomorphism between graphs.
  * Improve compareEqualSet (isomorphism) function.

## List of ideas

* Implement a new type of data to effeciently store graphs (bitfields).
    * Think a way of storing graphs in files.
* Graph search algorithm: fill the rows with the lower degrees first in order to reduce the search tree at the top.
    * Concept: nCr(n, k to 1) is much lower than nCr(n, k to n).
* Think and implement a new search algorithm.
* Idea for hashCode function:
    * Code (For N=3 case would only make sense to multiply edges set of nodes with label(v) = 3)
```
hash = 0
for v in nodes:
    hash += mult_all( edge_set(v) )
```

Thanks to Antonio.

* Permutation search:

```
mat graph[N][N]?

Case N=3
Graph representation:
1 -> {..., ..., ...}
2 -> {{...}, {...}, {...}}
3 -> {{...}, {...}, {...}}

permutations: n_possibilties?
available_nodes = {2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3}
1 ->
{2(1), 2(1), 2(1)}
    2 -> {{1, ?}, {1, ?}, {1, ?}} 
    to_complete = {2(1), 2(1), 2(1), 3(0), 3(0), 3(0)}
    available_nodes(2) = {3(0), 3(0), 3(0)}
    
    # condition to backtrack here??

    {{1, 3(1)}, {1, 3(1)}, {1, 3(1)}}
        to_complete = {3(1), 3(1), 3(1)}
        available_nodes(3) = {}
        3 -> {{2(2), ?, ?}, {2(2), ?, ?}, {2(2), ?, ?}}
            available_nodes == {} -> INVALID solution
    
    {..................}

{2(1), 2(1), 3(1)}
    2 -> {{1, ?}, {1, ?}, {?, ?}} 
    to_complete = {2(1), 2(1), 2(0), 3(1), 3(0), 3(0)}
    available_nodes(2) = {3(1), 3(0), 3(0)}
    
    {{1, 3(3)}, {1, 3(3)}, {3(1), 3(1)}}

    {{1, 3(1)}, {1, 3(2)}, {3(2), 3(2)}}

    {{1, 3(3)}, {1, 3(3)}, {3(3), 3(2)}}

    {{1, 3(3)}, {1, 3(3)}, {3(3), 3(1)}}

    {{1, 3(2)}, {1, 3(2)}, {3(2), 3(1)}}

    ...???

{2, 3, 3}
    2 -> {{1, ?}, {?, ?}, {?, ?}}
    to_complete = {2(1), 2(0), 2(0), 3(1), 3(1), 3(0)}
    available_nodes(2) = {3(1), 3(1), 3(0)}

{3, 3, 3}
    2 -> {{?, ?}, {?, ?}, {?, ?}} 

```

* Permutation search (without considering relations):

```
Case N=3 (only 1 possible solution):

1 -> { {3, 3, 3} }
2 -> { {3, 3, 3}, {3, 3, 3} }
3 -> { {1, 1, 1}, {2, 2, 2}, {2, 2, 2} }

available_conns = {2(6), 3(9)}
available(1) = {2(6), 3(9)}
1 -> 
{2, 2, 2}
    available_conns = {2(3), 3(9)}
    available(2) = {3(9)}
    2 -> {{1, 1, 1}, ...}
    {{1, 1, 1}, {3, 3, 3}}
        available_conns = {2(3), 3(6)}
        available(3) = {2(3)}
        3 -> {{2, 2, 2}, ...}
        {{2, 2, 2}, {2, 2, 2}, ...}
        conns_needed = 6, conns_available = 3 -> BACKTRACK

{2, 2, 3}
    ...

{2, 3, 3}
    ...

{3, 3, 3}
    available_conns = {2(6), 3(6)}
    available(2) = {3(6)}
    2 -> {...}
    {{3, 3, 3}, {3, 3, 3}}
        available_conns = {2(6)}
        available(3) = {2(6)}
        3 -> {{1, 1, 1}, ...}
        {{1, 1, 1}, {2, 2, 2}, {2, 2, 2}}
        if available_conns == {} -> VALID SOLUTION
```

Simple graph search algorithm using backtracking:

```
function countValidGraphs(sudokuLabels):
    total_nodes = N * N
    degrees = array[total_nodes] filled with 0
    required_degrees = map each node -> its label from sudokuLabels
    adjacency = matrix[total_nodes][total_nodes] filled with 0
    return backtrack(0, 1, adjacency, degrees, required_degrees)

function backtrack(u, v, adjacency, degrees, required_degrees):
    if all degrees match required_degrees:
        return 1

    if u >= total_nodes:
        return 0
    if v >= total_nodes:
        return backtrack(u + 1, u + 2, adjacency, degrees, required_degrees)

    count = 0

    # Try adding edge (u, v) if valid
    if labels[u] â‰  labels[v] and degrees[u] < required_degrees[u] and degrees[v] < required_degrees[v]:
        add edge (u, v) to adjacency
        degrees[u] += 1
        degrees[v] += 1
        count += backtrack(u, v + 1, adjacency, degrees, required_degrees)
        remove edge (u, v)
        degrees[u] -= 1
        degrees[v] -= 1

    # Try without adding the edge
    count += backtrack(u, v + 1, adjacency, degrees, required_degrees)

    return count
```
