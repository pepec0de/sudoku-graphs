# sudoku-graphs
Graph structures based on sudoku's concepts

## TODO List

* ~~Code memory reallocation for solutions vector (SudokuSet)~~.
* Change the arguments to pass by reference when necessary (optimization in runtime).
* Implement graph search algorithm.
* ~~Add in GraphSet labels vector to remove valueOfCell function.~~
* Implement sub-algo for binary sequences generation.
* Add code for graphical plots of graphs.
* Add in GraphSet struct k_bits matrix to optimize algorithm.

## List of ideas

* Implement a new type of data to effeciently store graphs (bitfields).
* Test optimizations in graph search algorithm.
